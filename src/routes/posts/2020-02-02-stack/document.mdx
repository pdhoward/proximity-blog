## The Conversation stack
There is a term in IT called a 'technology stack'. Briefly, it refers to a suite of hardware and software components that comprise an application, server or network.

At Strategic Machines, we like applying this concept to conversations. While the process of two people conversing is easy to envision, it is difficult to mimic with even the most sophisticated technology stack. The complexity of a conversation quickly mounts when we factor in the elliptical nature of any dialogue. 

For example, think about the dialogue between two people who are completing a restauraunt order. In a simple case, the interchange can be mapped out as a sequence of questions and answers. While a chat- or voice app for a simple case is easy to program, human interactions are rarely simple. Even a restauraunt order can quickly diverge into related but unexpected topics like ingredients, delivery, substitutions or pricing. The simple morphs quickly into the complex.  A business owner would rarely deploy automation that could not deliver high customer satisfaction. A menu-driven kiosk works; a general-purpose chatbot does not.

The more sophisticated conversational platforms, like IBM, Google or Microsoft, include capabilities to detect language, decipher intent, identify parts-of-speech or translate written text to voice. However, in our view, the most challenging element of developing a 'dialogue app' is the content. In order to keep pace, the platform needs to ingest content relevant to the domain, like Healthcare, Finance, or Retail. Machines 'learn' by processing sample datasets, and with well constructed algorithms, can infer the intent of a text based on the sample. The design, construction and maintenance of these 'knowledge datasets' are expensive, especially as the context of the domain broadens. Costs mount expotentially with dynamic content.

Our design philosophy for conversational apps is to build for the long-run:  make it simple, engaging and affordable. We focus on well-defined context, and help clients develop a dialogue flow that embraces human intervention where required. The Mayo Brothers noted over a century ago that high performance was achieved 'not by working more complexly, but more simply'.
