## Safe advertising. Safe messaging
Brand safety is on the mind of many marketing leaders these days. The big tech firms. such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, have captured a large share of the digital advertising market. And for good reason. In the past 10 years, we have a seen nothing short than a revolution in how people shop, buy, interact and promote ideas. The big tech firms have delivered 'free platforms' for use by consumers worldwide, and built businesses monetizing the personal information that consumers have disclosed voluntarily. Brilliant!

Which brings us to brand safety.

To scale cost effectively, big platforms rely on algorithms to place or display ads. Software systems parse key words from millions of queries and promote content and ads based on complex algorithms and pricing models. What we have all learned about this grand experiment over the past few decades is that while the process is startling, the outcomes are mixed. A sporting goods marketing team can leverage options on Facebook, for example, to reach a fisherman in Idaho, or a tennis player in Sydney, ingesting myriad personal details that might be relevant to the pitch. However, there are downsides with these monolithic platforms.

Recently, major brands, such as Coca Cola, P&G, and Verizon, have paused digital advertising to better understand the outcomes for their business. Adverse content negatively impacts adjacent brands. While cost effective, with brand impressions being delivered for as little as $3/m on social media, marketers have questioned the effectiveness of spend on sales conversions. And finally, the platforms seem to have been dragged into the challenging position of censuring content, with Facebook alone employing 35,000 people to scan over 100 billion messages a day for inappropriate speech. Even if the algorithm succeeds in placing the right ad with the right content, there is growing reputational risk associated with the big tech firms.
