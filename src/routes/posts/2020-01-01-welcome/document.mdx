## Context changes everything
Carson Wentz, the breakout quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles, knew something about context. For him, he never played the sport of football for thousands, but for One. And in playing for an Audience of One, he reached thousands with a much more compelling message.

Every marketer knows the value of context. If we have the right context, you can shape a more targeted message with a more precise and relevant set of actions. The consumer market is crowded and fast-paced, and marketers do not have the time or luxury of playing to undefined audiences and hoping for the best.

We are pleased to announce PROXIMITY - a unique messaging and advertising platform for marketers and merchants. PROXIMITY delivers compelling context for every marketer by transforming any venue into a location-based messaging platform. The venue provides well-defined context for reaching the shoppers and visitors with offers, ads, campaigns, and special updates. The PROXIMITY platform provides unique feature and capabilities, not readily available through 'big tech' platforms which dominates much of the global advertising market today:

** Each venue has well-defined demographics which supports targeted campaign planning

** Merchants serve as 'content curators', ensuring that messages and ads are appropriate for their customers. Venue owners attract sponsors consistent with their customer interests. The issues associated programmatic advertising are resolved.

** Shoppers can trigger a request for the latest offers, ads and information when entering a store. Or be prompted by products as they walk the aisles. Breakthrough Bluetooth technology, in concert with cognitive data science machines, turns physical space and relative time into a new and more compelling customer engagement.

** Marketers are able to speak to their customers with the content that matters, from slick video and audio productions to simple display ads or QR Codes. 

For Carson Wentz, his context is defined by the field of life, not the field of play. Isn't time for you to rethink the context for your audiences and deliver a set of messages customized to the one you're trying to reach.

PROXIMITY - a marketing and messaging platform from the team at Strategic Machines.
