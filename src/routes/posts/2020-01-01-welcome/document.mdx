## Context is important

Carson Wentz, the breakout quarterback for the Philadephia Eagles, new something about context. For him, he was never played the sport of football for thousands, but for One. And in playing for an Audience of One, he reached thousands with a much more compelling message.

Every marketer knows the value of context. If we have the right context, we can shape a more targeted message with a more precise and relevant set of actions. The consumer market is crowded and fast-paced, and marketers do not have the time or luxury of playing to undefined audiences and hoping for the best.

We are pleased to announce PROXIMITY - a unique messaging and advertising platform for marketers and merchants. PROXIMITY delivers compelling context for every marketer by transforming any venue into a location-based messaging platform.
