## Conversations are hard
The field of artificial intelligence and 'thinking machines' have made huge progress in the past decade. A seminal event in 2010 gave a glimpse of the power of ai when IBM's Watson beat two of the biggest champions at their game of Jeapordy - tackling native language challenges such as contextual clues, nuance, semantics, cultural puns and sarcasm. 

Some believe the holy grail of ai is the turing test, which is a 'make miss' measure of whether a computer can think like a human being. While Watson seemed to come close, it would never have achieved that level of 'game show' performance without the brilliant scientists behind the effort at IBM Research. What we really learned is that 'thinking machines' are still a distant goal. But what about 'conversational machines'.
