### Get Ready for a Revolution

This is part two of the [article](https://proximityblog.netlify.app/posts/2020-10-29/sensing) we posted last month. In that article we discussed the technology breakthrough with signaling devices that are permitting the production of unique digital identify tags for just pennies. Even low value, low margin products can be tagged. Our latest round of prototypes which emulate this technology demonstrate that a real disruption to the value chains of many businesses is on the horizon. The 'Physical Web' is coming online.

Google coined the term Physical Web. They first announced their vision in 2014 for an economy where everything is interconnected. The Internet of Things (IOT) is a more common term today, but we are still partial to PW. Afterall, the majority of the GDP is the sale and distribution of physical product. If we can connect the physical to digital in an affordable and effective manner, we open a vast array of new opportunities.

Let's start with the simple case. By tagging every product in a store with a unique ID which advertises itself on a regular cycle, we have gained great visibility to the status of our inventory. If these same products can provide us with their real-time movement and other data, such as temperature, we have even greater opportunity to remake the demand and supply chains of our operations and to serve customers more intensively. Of course, this requires very low-cost tags that can be pervasively deployed, and applications which ingest and rationalize those signals for human consumption. The effect of this simple case is to bring page views, clicks, shopping cart additions of online retail into the physical store. And it can all be done while preserving privacy and avoiding adverse ad placement. The Physical Web on steroids.

That's why we think there is a revolution coming. One hurdle, of course, is delivery of low-cost battery-free flexible tags at scale. These 'nano computers' will need to be commercial grade, and able to withstand a range of environmental conditions without fail. We expect that milestone to reached by mid-2021. 

A bigger hurdle is rethinking the value-chain so that the technology can be deployed and adopted. Everything changes. With the Physical Web, companies should use the opportunity to not just rework, but replace old processes built on assumptions that are outdated in a real-time world. With immediate transparency on inventory levels, customer demand, sales trends, price sensitivity, spoilage, shrinkage, and other key operational factors, whole new processes can be created for marketing, sales, customer service, distribution and delivery, and warranties. Organizations will need change management. New skills and training are required.

A revolution is coming, but it will require some forward thinking. Our prototypes on the Physical Web are signaling good things coming. Your products will be calling soon. So, give us a call and let's discuss the opportunities.
