## Discovering a hidden network

The power of networks are well understood among marketing and sales teams. With the right network effect, businesses will experience increasing resturns in customer acquisition, liquidity, retention and Brand impact. There are manifold examples of network effects in our digital economy, from OpenTable to Uber to Airbnb, where the platform delivers more than what was originally designed. At OpenTable, subscribers make a reservation, but also draw on the network to discover new restaurants, or explore menu options. The network effect is fully visible.
