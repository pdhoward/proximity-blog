## Discovering your hidden network

The power of networks is well understood among marketing and sales teams. With the right network effect, businesses will experience increasing returns in customer acquisition, liquidity, retention, and Brand impact. There are manifold examples of network effects in our digital economy, from OpenTable to Uber to Airbnb, where the platform delivers more than what was originally designed. At OpenTable, subscribers make a reservation, but also draw on the network to discover new restaurants or explore menu options. The network effect is fully visible.

But to drive a network effect, a business needs to understand its' network. At Strategic Machines, our analysis shows that market-based networks can operate very differently, pivoting on a variety of segment characteristics such as product attributes, demographics, and psychographics. But all networks, with time, can be leveraged for effect. 

Our mission at Strategic Machines is to help you reach your audience, building on the strength of your existing market network, and extending it to new markets, venues, and audiences. Our platform helps you to uncover the unexpected and makes visible whole new networks that are hidden from view. Our analysts are skilled at network analysis and prepared to help you think through opportunities for market match and product fit. As a trusted Brand, you have much to gain in working with the most trusted platform in audience messaging. Call us today for a discussion.
