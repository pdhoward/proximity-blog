## The digital experience platform 
There is a lot of attention given to software delivery processes in companies. And for good reason. Software is no longer a sideshow, but is the show. Even for physical good companies, software is integral to the product, delivering added function through embedded systems. The integrity of the software supply chain is critical to earnings and market growth for most companies, and that supply chain is managed through a process called devops (short for 'developer operations'). There are a lot of books written on the topic, so we won't go into it here. Just suffice it to say that a high-quality, well-orchestrated, real-time delivery process for code is the objective.

And there is an argument to be made that if software is such a valuable asset, then content even more so. After all, it is pretty hard to build or sell products without a high-quality BOM or product catalogue. The currency of data in a company is a critical asset, providing valuable insights into markets, customers, competitors and operations. This growing recognition of a neglected corporate asset led to the rise of master data management (MDM), data science and data analytic functions, and a recommitment among marketing and operation teams to value their data through fresh investments.

But just software has a publishing cycle, extending across diverse functions in the company, content also has a publishing cycle with numerous, critical functions engaged in the process. While a devops process supports delivery of code into production multiple times per day, the editorial process for content should support 'fast cycle' delivery of content to the market as well. We've observed some of these publishing cycles already at work in online markets, with dynamic pricing systems reacting to competitive market conditions on a real-time basis.

More so, there has been an explosion in new types of data that can be delivered innovatively and with precision. Video clips, animations, audio and functions are part of the new digital experience, where content itself can effectively 'programmed' to deliver a message. **Content is code.** Gartner recognized this radical shift in content management by shifting their research to 'digital experience platforms' (DXP) and away from traditional content management. Wearables, Google Home, Alexis, digial displays, chatbots and apps are all part of the content landscape, requiring new capabilities for workflow, localization, video production, and delivery. There is less emphasis on personalization, according to Gartner, and more on relevant experiences.
