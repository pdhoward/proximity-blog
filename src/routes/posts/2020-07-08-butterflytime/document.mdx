## The Monarch and the Marketer both need light.
Each year, Monarch butterflies make a heroic journey north from Mexico, traveling thousands of miles, only to return months later when the weather turns cold. [Scientists who study](http://www.reppertlab.org/) this iconic insect agree they are unique in many ways among living creatures. They weigh only an ounce, but somehow fly at speeds of 30 miles per hour, at heights of 12,000 feet, and at distances of 350 miles over open water. Most remarkable, they have a unique sense of time, permitting them to use the sun to navigate space, even as the sun travels across the sky. Scientists who have tracked this insect needed to understand how the Monarch knew it was traveling South if it kept the sun on its' left in the morning, but on its' right in the afternoon. 

[Monarch Watch](https://monarchwatch.org/blog/) is one organization that has been studying the Monarch for decades and helping to enlighten us on the gifts of this amazing creature. They observe that without a reliable clock, the Monarch would easily get turned around, and never reach their destination. The sun by itself would never work, but rather the Monarch distills both time and light to reach its goal. Research scientists identified this unique skill as a ['time-compensated sun compass'](https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2016/0415/Scientists-crack-mystery-of-migrating-monarch-navigation)
