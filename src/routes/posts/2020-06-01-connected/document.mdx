## Intersecting at the point of interest

Academics have been [studying](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05736) this topic for years: Identifying the interest of a person based on the context of their location. If an individual is standing in a hardware store, can we assume that they are interested in product or services that would be delivered by that store? Of course, marketing teams have an intense interest in this topic as well.

While the adoption of location-based services has doubled in the United States in the past decade to over 250 mobile users, the disclosure of geodata appears to be selective. Users are comfortable disclosing their location for services like directions, weather or rides, but are more reluctant for other services like shopping and healthcare. Smartphones generate vast stream of data on where consumers live and work, but privacy concerns and data misuse have forced the major carriers in the US and Europe to stop selling data to companies. A consumer understands the potential for abuse, making many vigilant about their privacy. However, location data that is shared by a consumer for fitness purposes may be repackaged and sold on secondary markets for other applications. [RetailNext](https://retailnext.net/en/home/) tracks more than 500 million shoppers per year by collecting data from more than 65,000 sensors installed in thousands of retail locations. For many, this level of surveillance raises new concerns about privacy, identification, and data security.

At Strategic Machines, we understand that trust is at the intersection of a productive conversation among all parties. Our platform is designed to promote unparalleled trust in the field of location-based services, ensuring that each conversation is private, secured and protected. Shop owners curate content, sponsors serve messages, and consumers benefit from unparalleled services real-time. Data is preserved only for the span of conversation. Privacy rights are maintained forever. Interactions are engaged voluntarily. Trust is promoted continuously. This is our design point for a connected conversation.
