## The decision process can be simplified

There is a branch of mathematics that deals with a problem called the 'axiom of choice'. It is somewhat of an abstract concept, which states that if you have an infinite number of containers, each with at least one object, it is possible to select exactly one object from each container. You are probably thinking 'Say what?'. Maybe it is best to leave mathematics to mathematicians, but there is something practical to glean here. Essentially, when faced with an overwhelming number of decisions, there is a 'choice function' that we can construct to help navigate. This choice function makes the complex simple. Let's see if we can pull this into the realm of reaching customers.

The Google AdWords platform is a powerful tool for any business, with what may seem like an infinite number of choices. A single Google Ad account can contain thousands of campaigns, with thousands of ad groups per campaign and multiple keywords per ad group. Do the math and the complexity mounts. More importantly, the outcomes from these campaigns may result in low conversions and high costs, raising important questions about campaign design, or even the process itself. After all, we're attempting to catch someone's attention based on a phrase entered into the search bar of a browser. Some liken it to operating with a blindfold, never getting a real handle on audience or intent. The challenges are understandable. The process is complex. So, maybe the axiom of choice is to simplify.

With PROXIMITY, we have simplified the 'grid' for reaching customers by taking the guess work out of sales and marketing. The shopping venue is the context, and based the objectives of your campaign, you can target the right audience at the right time with relevant messages. More than that, you can engage your customers with winsome rich content, so that a message takes on features which draw customers into a conversation. The process is not only easy to understand, but so are the economics. The axiom of choice for PROXIMITY is finite: Who is your audience and what is your message. We help you manage everything from there.

Give us a call, and let's make the complex simple.
