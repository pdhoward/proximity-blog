## Context is the Design Point 
We'll get straight to the point. It is hard to have a conversation without context. The corollary is also true: a well-defined context promotes a productive dialogue.

PROXIMITY provides audience reach world-wide where context is part of the package. Leading venues use PROXIMITY to make available to their customers sponsored and curated content, enhancing their digital experiences while shopping or visiting the venue. The venues are profiled by the Strategic Machines design teams in concert with venue owners, providing a rich set of location, traffic, census, trend and demographic profiles. These profiles are dynamic, current, and compelling, helping Marketers to make decisions on message and ad placements for optimal impact and outcomes.

Our road map for PROXIMITY goes further, providing functions for micro-targeting using opt-in location tracking technologies. Your products speak, prompting shoppers or visitors with enhanced Brand content or offers, through advanced Bluetooth technologies (expected release date: 2021). While beacons have been part of the Retail industry landscape for over a decade, what is new is the radical cost reduction we expect to deliver with our partners, making feasible a new range of use cases. We're excited about the prospects and direction!

When context is part of the design, conversations are on point. As part of this context, marketers are in a better position to discern intent, and customize their campaign messages accordingly. The contexts for supermarkets, department stores, auto dealers and sporting events provide important insights on intent, and greater precision for promoting the Brand and enhancing the experience.

So make context part of the design for your next marketing campaign, and let us help you deliver a rich digital experience on the PROXIMITY platform.
