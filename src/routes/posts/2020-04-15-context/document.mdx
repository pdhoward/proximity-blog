## Context is the Design Point 
We'll get straight to the point. It is hard to have a conversation without context. The corollary is also true: a well-defined context promotes a productive dialogue.

PROXIMITY provides audience reach world-wide where context is given. Leading venues use PROXIMITY to deliver sponsored and curated content to their customers, enhacing their digital experience while shopping or visiting the venue. 

Marketers, sponsors and alliance organizations have an uncommon opportunity to reach an audience, where visitor demographics is known. This removes much of the uncertainty in target marketing, improving CPM, CTR, DX and conversions.
