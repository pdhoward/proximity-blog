## Context is the Design Point 
We'll get straight to the point. It is hard to have a conversation without context. The corollary is also true: a well-defined context promotes a productive dialogue.

PROXIMITY provides audience reach world-wide where context is part of the package. Leading venues use PROXIMITY to make available sponsored and curated content to their customers, enhancing their digital experience while shopping or visiting the venue. The venues are profiled by the Strategic Machines design teams, providing location, traffic, census, trend and demographic profiles. These profiles are dynamic, current and compelling, helping Marketers to make decisions on message and ad placements for optimal impact and outcomes.

Our road map for PROXIMITY goes further, providing functions for micro-targeting using opt-in location tracking technologies. Your products speak, prompting shoppers or visitors with enhanced Brand content or offers, through advanced bluetooth technologies (expected release date: 2021). While beacons have been part of the Retail industry landscape for over a decade, what's new is the radical cost reduction we expect to deliver with our partners, making feasible a new range of use cases. We're excited about the prospects and direction!

So make context part of your design for your next marketing campaign, and let us help you deliver a rich digital experience on the PROXIMITY platform.
