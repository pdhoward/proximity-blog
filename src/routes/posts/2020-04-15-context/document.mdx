## Context is the Design Point 
We'll get straight to the point. It is hard to have a conversation without context. The corollary is also true: a well-defined context promotes a productive dialogue.

PROXIMITY provides audience reach world-wide where context is part of the package. Leading venues use PROXIMITY to make available sponsored and curated content to their customers, enhacing their digital experience while shopping or visiting the venue. The venues are profiled by the Strategic Machines design teams, providing location, traffic, census, trend and demographic profiles. These profiles are dynamic, current and compelling, helping Marketers to make decisions on message and ad placements for optimal impact and outcomes.

Marketers, sponsors and alliance organizations have an uncommon opportunity to reach an audience, where visitor demographics is known. This removes much of the uncertainty in target marketing, improving CPM, CTR, DX and conversions.
