### Competing in real-time

There is a landmark study by the Boston Consulting Group that was published in the early 1990s about time-based competition. The study concluded that any company in an Industry which had a 2X time advantage over its' competition would experience a 4X advantage in profit performance. In other words, if a company processes a mortgage application twice as fast as the competition, it is going to generate way more profit for its' shareholders than other companies in the Industry.

Think about that: 2x time drives 4x financial performance.

At Strategic Machines, we have been giving time a lot of thought recently, recognizing that value chains are about to be turbocharged. Our world runs by the clock, but what has caught our attention is learning to compete in real-time.

Let's step back for a minute and review briefly the time journey of our globally integrated economy. In the early 1900s, Frederick Taylor introduced the notion of synchronized operations with his set of scientific management practices. The 'industrial revolution' was nascent, but the potential was captivating. Process was componentized into discrete steps, and efficiencies and speed were the watchwords of management practices. A clockwork world emerged, and modern life accelerated. But while factories and logistics were optimized, office work lagged until whole new management concepts were introduced in the 1980s by Michael Hammer, the progenitor of business process reengineering. Dr. Hammer's perspective is outlined in an article published by the Harvard Business Review in 1990, entitled "Reengineering Work: Don't Automate, Obliterate". With almost of 100 years of economic performance bookended by Taylor and Hammer, and empirical evidence published by BCG, companies were in command of time.
